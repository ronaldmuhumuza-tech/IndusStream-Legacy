# IndusStream – Industrial Telemetry Platform

A hands-on project exploring how telemetry systems collect, process, and visualise data across edge and cloud environments.

The project evolves through progressively more advanced implementations, moving from simulation to real hardware and toward scalable cloud architectures.

## Network Infrastructure Context

This system is designed to operate within a broader simulated enterprise network environment. This approach demonstrates end-to-end system design, spanning network infrastructure, edge processing, cloud ingestion, and analytics.

This complementary project models:

- VLAN segmentation and Layer 2 design  
- Routing and Layer 3 architecture (OSPF)  
- Hybrid cloud connectivity and more 

Together, these projects reflect real-world enterprise architectures where edge telemetry systems are deployed within structured, secure, and scalable network environments.

## Projects

### [v1 – Serverless Telemetry](./v1-serverless-telemetry/)

Simulated telemetry data is sent to AWS via API Gateway, processed by Lambda, and stored in S3.

Focus:
- Serverless architecture
- Event-driven processing
- Cloud-native monitoring

### [v2 – Edge Dashboard](./v2-edge-dashboard/)

Real sensor data from an Arduino is collected and processed on a Raspberry Pi, stored locally in SQLite, and visualised via a Python Dash dashboard.

Focus:
- Edge computing
- Local data processing and storage
- Real-time visualisation over LAN

### [v3 – Edge to Cloud](./v3-edge-to-cloud/)

Extending the system from local edge processing to cloud-based telemetry ingestion using using MQTT and AWS IoT services.

Focus:
- IoT architecture
- Scalable telemetry ingestion
- Edge-to-cloud integration

##  [v4 — CI/CD Automation & Deployment Engineering](./v4-automated-telemetry-platform/)

Adds automated deployment workflows and DevOps practices to the telemetry platform.

Focus:
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Automated AWS Lambda deployment
- IAM secret management
- Deployment automation
- Operational workflows
